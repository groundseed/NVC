# NVC
Version control for the masses  
NVC stands for No(obas) version control. Have you ever zipped your code with its compilation date and called it version control? Well, now you can do it with a utility!  
It supports zip, tar and 7z (soon)

## Installing
Just throw it in your path or add an alias that runs it.
